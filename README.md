# Debt Settler

This is a static website that allows to simplify transactions such that for a given number of pending transactions, the least number of transactions are found to resolve the network.
Consider the example where we have 3 people, A, B and C.

If A paid 12 which was distributed equally then B and C owe A 4.
Now if C paid 24 but only shared between C and B then B owes C 12.

If we simplify the graph, B simply owes both A and C 8.
